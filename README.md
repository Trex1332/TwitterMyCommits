This is my goal of making a bot that will tweet when you make changes to your github projects. 
it will use your Twitter developer accounts api as input and github api as well name and project name.
it will then tweet after every 10 minuets is what it is set too may change to a custom amount of time.
it will only tweet when there is a new commit message it will never do the same message twice.
